# HDRVideo3DGan
## An efficient technique for generating low-cost HDR videos (Ongoing work).
Detailed explaination and steps to run coming soon....

This code uses the pytorch template (scaffolding) that already defines a high level flow, configuration mechanishm and code organization for training models. The flow ensures the popular and effective guidelines are followed while training the models, such as seeding before training to ensure determinism/reproducibility, train/val split, etc..
